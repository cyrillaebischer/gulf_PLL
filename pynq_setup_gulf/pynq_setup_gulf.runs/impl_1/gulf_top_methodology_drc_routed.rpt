TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.032 ns between statemachine/state_s_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and statemachine/adr_v_reg[11]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.032 ns between statemachine/state_s_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and statemachine/adr_v_reg[6]/R (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
